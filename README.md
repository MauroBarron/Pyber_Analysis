##Overall Summary of County Bus Rides by City Types

#Ride Summary
  Based on the Pyber Rides Summary data it appears to reflect what probably most people would expect. 
	  Total Rides: Urban areas have app 3x as many rides as Suburban areas which in turn have app 4x as many rides as rural areas.
		Total Drivers: Urban areas have many more drivers, likely accounted for having more bus lines or longer daily coverage.
		Total Fares show expected breakdowns, but not by the same factors as Total Rides.
		Average per Ride is interesting as it reflects Rural areas generating app $4 more per ride that Suburban which in turn generating app $6 more than Urban.   This may be accounted for by longer distances in Rural areas costing more per ride. 
		Average per Driver. This is dominated by the Rural areas at almost 3x the rate of Urban. 



Is there a correlation between average fare and the total rides for city types?
	• There is an inverse relationship between average fares total rides . Rural areas generating app $4 more per ride that Suburban which in turn generating app $6 more than Urban.   This may be accounted for by longer distances in Rural areas perhaps costing more per ride. 



Summary of plotted fares for city type over time
	• The plot  supports observations also found in the summary data; Urban fare totals are much bigger than Suburban with are bigger than Rural.
	• All types follow a similar pattern over the months of Jan-2019 and May-2019, with Fare peaks in near end of February and March. This appears to be worth exploring. What was happening at this time that increased ridership?  For Urban fares, there is unusual fluctuation in March, not seen in other months which is also worth exploring. 
	• Overall I would say there is more exploring that can be done for each City Type to understand usage peaks and dips and perhaps leverage such new analysis for a ride increasing program.
